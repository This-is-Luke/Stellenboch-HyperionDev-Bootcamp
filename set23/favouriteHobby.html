				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Gaming is more than just a way to pass time. It's a hobby that
					challenges your skills, tests your reflexes, and connects you
					with other players. I love playing competitive shooters, where
					every move counts and teamwork is key. There's nothing like the
					thrill of winning a match with your friends or beating a tough
					opponent.
