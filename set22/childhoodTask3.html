		<h2>Studying Wikipeadia on <u>Black Holes.</u></h2>
		<p>
			I was one of <i>those</i> kids, the ones that found companionship in
			tech, not people, and Wikipedia was the only resource back then that
			would teach a kid whatever they wanted to know, and didn't have snarky
			librarians say, "that's not for children."
		</p>

		<h2>Playing with <u>animals</u>, the bigger the better.</h2>
		<p>
			I found animals were better friends than kids my own age, and quickly
			learned I liked working at the SPCA as a <i>volunteer</i>.

		<h1>Toys</h1>
		<br />
		<h2>My favorite toy was whichever toy I hadnt <u>disassembeld</u> yet.</h2>
		<p>
			I was always a <i>curious</i> child. Wondering on how toys worked
			rather than playing silly games with them, I disasembeld them to see what would
			make them tick.
		</p>
		<h2>My second favorite toy was whichever I hadnt <u>re-assembelled</u> yet.</h2>
		<p>
			I also liked <i>fixing</i> things as much as taking them appart, mostly
			the things I broke in trying to find out how they worked.
