				<li>
					Oneness and interconnectedness: Watts believed in the
					interconnectedness of all things and the idea that we are all
					part of a larger whole. He encouraged people to move beyond the
					illusion of separateness and to recognize the fundamental unity
					of all existence.
				</li>
				<li>
					Mindfulness and presence: Watts emphasized the importance of
					being present in the moment and cultivating a mindful awareness
					of one's experience. He encouraged people to let go of worries
					about the future or regrets about the past, and to focus on the
					present moment as the only time that truly exists.
				</li>
				<li>
					Spiritual exploration and self-discovery: Watts believed that
					each person has the potential for spiritual growth and
					self-discovery, and he encouraged people to explore their own
					inner landscapes in order to find meaning and purpose in their
					lives. He believed that spiritual exploration could lead to a
					greater sense of connection, creativity, and fulfillment in life.
