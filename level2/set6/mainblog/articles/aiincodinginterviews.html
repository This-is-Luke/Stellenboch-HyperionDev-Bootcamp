				Introduction: As the field of coding and software development
				continues to evolve, so too must our approach to evaluating
				technical skills during the interview process. Traditional coding
				interviews often focus on manual problem-solving abilities, but with
				the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its increasing
				prominence in the industry, there is a growing consensus that coding
				interviews should adapt to include AI and allow the utilization of
				relevant tools. In this article, we explore the controversial topic
				of incorporating AI in coding interviews and discuss the potential
				benefits it offers in keeping up with the future demands of coding.

				<p class="highlight">
					<strong>1. Real-World Alignment:</strong>
					Incorporating AI into coding interviews aligns with the
					real-world scenarios that developers encounter on a daily basis.
					AI tools and frameworks have become an integral part of modern
					software development, enabling developers to automate repetitive
					tasks, enhance productivity, and solve complex problems
					efficiently. By allowing candidates to utilize AI and relevant
					tooling during interviews, employers gain a better understanding
					of their ability to work effectively in real-world coding
					environments.
				</p>

				<p class="highlight">
					<strong>2. Problem-Solving Efficiency:</strong>
					Coding interviews have traditionally assessed a candidate's
					problem-solving skills in isolation, without considering the
					availability of tools and resources. However, the use of AI and
					related tools can significantly improve problem-solving
					efficiency. Allowing candidates to leverage these technologies
					during interviews enables them to showcase their ability to
					identify appropriate solutions, leverage existing libraries, and
					efficiently implement code. By embracing AI and tooling, coding
					interviews can better assess a candidate's ability to leverage
					available resources effectively.
				</p>

				<p class="highlight">
					<strong>3. Adaptability and Future Readiness:</strong>
					As AI continues to advance, it is poised to play an increasingly
					vital role in coding and software development. By integrating AI
					into coding interviews, employers can assess a candidate's
					adaptability and readiness to embrace emerging technologies.
					Candidates who are familiar with AI concepts, tooling, and their
					application demonstrate their ability to stay ahead of the curve
					and adapt to evolving industry trends, making them valuable
					assets to forward-thinking organizations.
				</p>

				<p class="highlight">
					<strong>4. Ethical Considerations:</strong>
					While incorporating AI into coding interviews presents numerous
					advantages, ethical considerations must be addressed. It is
					essential to ensure that the AI tools and frameworks used during
					interviews are fair, unbiased, and do not discriminate against
					candidates based on gender, race, or any other protected
					characteristic. Transparent guidelines should be established to
					govern the usage of AI, ensuring equal opportunities for all
					candidates while upholding ethical standards in the evaluation
					process.
				</p>

				<p class="highlight">
					<strong>5. Skills Evaluation Beyond Syntax:</strong>
					Coding interviews that allow AI tooling usage can assess
					candidates based on a broader set of skills beyond syntax
					proficiency. They can evaluate a candidate's ability to
					understand and implement AI algorithms, interpret and optimize
					models, and effectively use AI frameworks. This comprehensive
					evaluation provides a more holistic understanding of a
					candidate's capabilities, helping employers identify individuals
					with the skill sets required for AI-driven development.
				</p>

			<p class="conclusion">
				Conclusion: Incorporating AI and allowing tooling usage in coding
				interviews represents a progressive approach to evaluating technical
				skills. By embracing these advancements, organizations can align
				their hiring practices with the future demands of coding and
				software development. Through the inclusion of AI, coding interviews
				become more realistic, efficient, and future-ready, enabling
				employers to identify candidates who can thrive in an industry
				increasingly driven by AI and automation. It is crucial to strike a
				balance between embracing technology and maintaining ethical
				standards, ensuring a fair and unbiased evaluation process that
				promotes innovation and diversity in the field. By embracing the
				potential of AI in coding interviews, we can better assess
				candidates' abilities and foster a workforce that is well-prepared
				to meet the challenges and opportunities of the rapidly evolving
				coding landscape.
