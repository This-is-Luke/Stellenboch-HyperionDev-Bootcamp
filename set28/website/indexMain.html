<!-- The wording of the task could be better, at one point it asks for a store, at another point it asks for a 
hobbies page and at another point it asks for a web portfolio. That said this task took some time to complete, a full 16 hours -->

<!-- 

  Below is the main index page for my landing page that includes the 
  about me section and the 3D word animation. I have included the testimonials as well.

  The div with id container-fluid I use throughout all pages as a nav bar.

  in all the pages I used bootstrap and css to achieve the styling I wanted
  In each page I will include minimal comments as I have commented on the index page which is then duplicated partly on other pages.

									<h1>About</h1>
									<p>
										Hi there! I'm a creative and passionate person who
										loves to explore new things. I graduated in 2010
										and ran a photography business for a few years,
										capturing beautiful moments and memories. Then I
										switched to graphic design for 3 years, where I
										learned how to create stunning visuals and logos.
										Recently, I started coding and am doing a full
										stack web dev bootcamp through Stellenbosch
										University and Hyperion Dev. I'm excited to learn
										more about web development and build amazing
										websites and apps!
										I have taken insperation from many a website to build this,
										while my skills are not there yet, I am proud of what I achieved
										in just a few months. I took insperation from sites like 
										<a href="https://lokkeestudios.com/">Lokkees Studios</a>
										and
										<a href="https://coryhughart.com/">Cory Hughart</a>
